// .sks files are archived in SKEmitterNode instances. Our manipulations (attribute changes) in the Xcode particle editor actually change the real properties on SKEmitterNode instances.
// We will need to retrieve a copy of that node by loading it from our app bundle
// In order to mimic the API that apple uses for sound actions, we will build a Swift extension to add a new method to the SKEmitterNode class.
// This is called a category in Objective-C, but is called an extension in Swift.

// Use a swift extension to extend the String class to have a property named length(count).
